## Purpose of This Project

My version of rock-paper-scissors against a computer. This project is an activity to practice writing Javascript syntax while working with loops, logical operations, and conditional statements.

## Current Game Release

This game can be played by going to the deployed link at the top of the Readme file.
## Future Updates

In future releases, I plan to update the game to:

* Update code to round down the number of rounds if the Player inputs a decimal (e.g. 3.5 or 4.3).
* Add code to prevent Player from inputting anything other than rock, paper, or scissors.
* Add a feature to give a choice if the Player wants to play the game again after it ends.
* Add some visuals to the webpage depending on certain conditions.
* Run the game as a web application, rather than through alert messages and prompts.
